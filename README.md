# Shell By Example Example Files

This repo contains a fake folder with a bunch of files, mainly to give me a basic place to navigate around in my [Shell By Example Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeGDC-asx6EaBtVlOP3yuJA_uTNNkDpU7) on YouTube. Go ahead and clone it if you want to operate on the same files as me while you follow along.
